## Introduction

This repository provides information regarding the construction of a
multi weighted and un-weighted polygenic risk score (PRSsum).

Suppose that we have multiple PRSs, all using the same p variants\*, and
we sum them with weights. The formula for the kth PRS:

$\_{n=1}^{10} n^2

We provide example data set in ./Example directory and code to generate
PRS PRSsum.
